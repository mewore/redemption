# Redemption

## TODO

- [x] 💚 MVP idea - platformer puzzle(?) where you collect sticks as quickly as possible
    - The player is a bird that needs to collect every stick in the level in order to proceed
    - There is no time limit but there are little bird companions that help carry more sticks, which disappear (if
      accompanying the player) at a certain time interval
    - There may also be some obstacles that hit the player, making them drop all carried sticks or making all bird
      companions vanish (yes, totally vanish and not die)
